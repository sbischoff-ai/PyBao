# PyBao

An implementation of *Bao*, an old african game where you put gemstones in little round pits.

This is a simple Bao variant where the is no store or house, there are only clock-wise sowings and capturing is always allowed. Captured seeds are added to the composite sowing.

This Bao variant contains the possibility of perpetual sowings (infinite turns), which I have not dealt with yet.
The AI is challenging but beatable. (It will always take the turn that maximizes captured seeds.)
